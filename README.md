# Adopta Blueprint
This is the master blueprint for Adopta projects. You start your project by forking this blueprint, and use it as the template for your project.
Adopta projects take advantage of Github functionality, and run as Github Pages using Jekyll. Everthing about this project is managed through three mechinms:

* _config.yml - This is the heart of the project, and you will use to edit every aspect of the project from the title, to listing the data sets--everything starts here.
* /blog - Tell the stories through the Jekyll blog, keeping potential consumers aware of every step along the way, so they can experience from start to finish.
* Github Issues - The roadmap, changelog, and all conversations around each Adopta project should occur via Github issues, acting as central social thread for projects.

Our goal is to keep the Adopta proces as simple as possible. It is purely about targeting valuable government datasets and topics, and moving forward the open data conversation by making sure they are truly available in a machine readable way.

Fork this repository, and get to work on your own Adopta project today, and join the movement.

<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This project makes the data associated with President Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative available in an open and editable format. By using the <a href="http://adopta.agency/">Adopta.Agency</a> framework - that is, adopting Department of Education datasets - the data that the department has called "statistical indicators" for young men of color will be cleaned up, standardized, expanded upon, and made machine- and human-readable.</p>

<p>This site uses the <a href="http://adopta.agency/">Adopta.Agency</a> open data blueprint, which is an <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/adopta-blueprint">open Github template designed to be forked</a> and used to improve government and other public datasets.</p>

<p>You can find more information about this project on the <a href="http://adopta.agency/">Adopta.Agency website</a>.</p>

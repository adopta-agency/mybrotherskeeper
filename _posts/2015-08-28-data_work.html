<p>Today I started to download the 130+ datasets that are <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/my-brothers-keeper-key-statistical-indicators-on-boys-and-men-of-color">associated with My Brother's Keeper on the data.gov website</a>.</p> 

<p>I'm using Google Docs to upload the files and convert them to CSV files. (The ones I've worked with so far are Excel files.) Then I use Kin Lane's <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/csv-converter/converter.html">CSV converter tool</a> to turn these into JSON files.</p>

<p>But wow, the data is a mess. Many of the files have weird names so it's not immediately apparent what the data is. They're Excel files, and are created so as to look pretty when printed out, but not to be at all functional when it comes to actually <em>doing anything</em> with the data.</p>

<p>My goal is to work on uploading a dozen or so files a day. Then I'll go back through and clean the data up further.</p>
